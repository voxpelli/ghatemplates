# Workflows

My personal reusable GitHub Actions workflows (geared towards node.js)

(_No versioning strategy for these ones, use as inspiration or at your own risk_)

## Reusable Workflows

### Code Quality & Analysis

* [dependency-review.yml](./.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml) â€“ Wrapper around [`actions/dependency-review-action`](https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action) thar configures it to eg. fail for GPL and AGPL dependencies (as is typical in the JS ecosystem)
* [lint.yml](./.github/workflows/lint.yml) â€“ Runs the npm script `check` on your codebase for linting etc.
* [type-check.yml](./.github/workflows/type-check.yml) â€“ Performs TypeScript type checking across multiple TS versions.

### Publishing & Release Automation

* [release-please-4.yml](./.github/workflows/release-please-4.yml) â€“ Full flow for [googleapis/release-please-action@v4`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) â€“ both PR generation and NPM publishing.
* [release-please-bot.yml](./.github/workflows/release-please-bot.yml) â€“ Like `release-please-4.yml` but uses a bot account rather than the `GITHUB_TOKEN` when it generates PR:s etc.
* [release-please-oidc.yml](./.github/workflows/release-please-oidc.yml) â€“ Like `release-please-bot.yml` but uses OIDC authentication rather than a `NPM_TOKEN`.

### Testing

* [exit-silently-on-unsupported.yml](./.github/workflows/exit-silently-on-unsupported.yml) â€“ Tests that CLI tools exists silently on unsupported Node.js versions (see eg. [version-guard](https://github.com/voxpelli/version-guard)).
* [simple-test.yml](./.github/workflows/simple-test.yml) â€“ Runs `npm test` on `lts/*` - nothing more, nothing less.
* [test-pg.yml](./.github/workflows/test-pg.yml) â€“ Like `test.yml` but starts a Postgres service before and includes Postgres version as another dimension in the test matrix.
* [test.yml](./.github/workflows/test.yml) â€“ Runs a npm test script (defaulting to `test-ci`) across an OS + Node.js version matrix.

### Utility

* [reusable-npm-run.yml](./.github/workflows/reusable-npm-run.yml) â€“ Runs arbitrary npm scripts as a reusable workflow.
* [sync-reusable.yml](./.github/workflows/sync-reusable.yml) â€“ Reusable flow that runs an npm script and generates a PR whenever the outcome is new.

### Deprecated

* [codeql-analysis.yml](./.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) â€“ Deprecated: Use the built-in default one in GitHub instead.
* [gh-publish.yml](./.github/workflows/gh-publish.yml) â€“ Deprecated: Use the release-please workflows above instead.
* [release-please.yml](./.github/workflows/release-please.yml) â€“ Deprecated: Use the newer release-please workflows above.

## Context

### Environments

These environments are typically expected to be locked down to only be allowed to be used from the main branch.

* `npm` â€“ used by all the `release-please` actions when publishing to NPM. `release-please-4.yml` and `release-please-bot.yml` has a `NODE_TOKEN` secret saved in it while `release-please-oidc.yml` instead has the environment configured in the NPM Trusted Publisher config for the package.
* `pr-bot` â€“ used by `release-please-bot.yml`, `release-please-oidc.yml` and `sync-reusable.yml` to find the `APP_PEM` to use with [`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) to create the token needed to create a PR.

### Scripts

These are the default/required [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/scripts) in the above workflows:

* `check` â€“ used by `lint.yml` for linting and code quality checks.
* `test` â€“ used by `simple-test.yml` for running all tests (often includes eg. linting).
* `test-ci` â€“ used by `test.yml` and `test-pg.yml` to run all non-linting / non-check tests.
* (arbitrary script) â€“ used by `reusable-npm-run.yml` and `sync-reusable.yml` for custom automation.

## Setup

### Release Please

1. Add the new files:
    - Either by using [a patch](./release-please.patch):
        1. Download it to `~/Downloads/release-please.patch`
        2. In your project, apply the patch: `git apply --reject ~/Downloads/release-please.patch`
        3. Find any `.rej` files and apply their changes manually
    - Or by adding [all the files](#release-please-files) manually
4. Run `npm install -D validate-conventional-commit` to add the dependency of `.husky/commit-msg`
5. Change `{".":"0.0.0"}` in `.github/release-please/manifest.json` to the latest tagged version of the module
6. Configure the repo as [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#for-github-actions) in NPM:
    1. Go to [`npmjs.com/package/installed-check/access`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/installed-check/access)
    2. Set `release-please.yml` as the `Workflow filename`
    3. Set `npm` as the `Environment name`
    1. (Out of scope but still good to check on that page: Check that the module requires 2FA to publish)
7. Go to [`/settings/environments`](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-bunyan-adaptor/settings/environments) in your repository:
    1. Create a `npm` environment and **importantly** set its `Deployment branches and tags` to either `Protected branches only` or to `Selected branch and tags`, adding only `main`
    2. Create a `pr-bot` environment, add the [`APP_PEM`](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/automating-projects-using-actions#example-workflow-authenticating-with-a-github-app) secret for the GitHub App that will create the PR:s. Also, **importantly**, set its `Deployment branches and tags` to either `Protected branches only` or to `Selected branch and tags`, adding only `main`
8. If a pre-existing repository: Ensure that no tag protection is on in [`/settings/rules`](https://github.com/voxpelli/async-htm-to-string/settings/tag_protection) (previously [`/settings/tag_protection`](https://github.com/voxpelli/async-htm-to-string/settings/rules))
9. Go to [`/settings/actions`](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-bunyan-adaptor/settings/actions) in your repository:
    1. Since we use a GitHub app to create PR:s, we can unclick `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests `
    2. Then we should set `Allow voxpelli, and select non-voxpelli, actions and reusable workflows ` + `Allow actions created by GitHub` and then add these to the `Allow or block specified actions and reusable workflows` list:
        ```
        googleapis/release-please-action@v4,
        mtfoley/pr-compliance-action@*,
        ```
10. Commit your changes as semantic versioning (eg. `ci: added automatic release flow`) and push it
11. You should now be done :tada: And Release Please will be creating PR:s and triggering releases for you.

### Release Please Config

Optional [additional config](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/d5f2ca8a2cf32701f1d87a85bbc37493b1db65c2/docs/cli.md#bootstrapping) to be added to `.github/release-please/config.json`:

```json
  "bump-minor-pre-major": true,
  "bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major": true,
```

### Release Please Files

Instead of downloading and applying [the patch](./release-please.patch), you can add these files manually:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/release-please/config.json</code></summary>

```json
